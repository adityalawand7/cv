Title ->
A simple website using just HTML and simple CSS

Description ->
I made this during learning Web Development course from Angela Yu. This is a very simple HTML and CSS website which is good for beginners as it helps to clear the foundation concepts needed for starting further learning in WebDev.

Installation ->
This does not require any special installation. Just download the files and place them in one folder. Do remember to change the image path according to the path where you placed all the files.
